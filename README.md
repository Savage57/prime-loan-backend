+
+## Quick Start
+
+1. **Install dependencies**
+   ```bash
+   npm install
+   ```
+
+2. **Setup environment**
+   ```bash
+   cp .env.example .env
+   # Edit .env with your configuration
+   ```
+
+3. **Build and start**
+   ```bash
+   npm run build
+   npm start
+   ```
+
+4. **Start workers** (in separate terminals)
+   ```bash
+   node dist/workers/pollers/billPaymentsPoller.js
+   node dist/workers/pollers/transfersPoller.js
+   node dist/workers/loans/penaltiesCron.js
+   node dist/workers/savings/maturitiesWorker.js
+   ```
+

+## Architecture
+
+### Clean Architecture Layers
+```
+/src
+  /app                 # Application layer (routes, middleware)
+  /modules            # Business modules (loans, transfers, etc.)
+    /{module}
+      /domain         # Business logic
+      /application    # Use cases
+      /infrastructure # Data access
+      /http          # Controllers
+  /shared            # Shared utilities and services
+  /workers           # Background job processors
+```
+
+### Key Principles
+- **Ledger-First**: All money movements create ledger entries
+- **Idempotency**: Duplicate operations return cached responses
+- **Polling**: Pending transactions are automatically reconciled
+- **Circuit Breakers**: Provider failures are handled gracefully
+- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for compliance
+
+## Development
+
+### Running in Development
+```bash
+npm run dev
+```
+
+### Building for Production
+```bash
+npm run build
+```
+
+### Database Migrations
+New collections are created automatically. Existing data is preserved.
+
+### Testing
+```bash
+npm test  # When tests are added
+```
+
+## Monitoring
+
+### Health Checks
+- Application: `GET /health`
+- Ledger: `GET /v2/admin/reconciliation/inconsistencies`
+
+### Metrics
+Prometheus metrics available at `/metrics`
+
+### Logging
+Structured JSON logs with request correlation and PII redaction
